      <p>Acknowledged</p>
      <p>Good... Good... Yes... I heard there was a giant crab out there, so watch your back.</p>
      <p>That is not my concern. I seek the giant tortoise.</p>
      <p>The Great A'Tuin hasn't been spotted in this sector of space in over 1,000 years. Your chances of finding him are slim.</p>
      <p>Tis but a small matter of belief. If one believes A'Tuin will appear they will.</p>
